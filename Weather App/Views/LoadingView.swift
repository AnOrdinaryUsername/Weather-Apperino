                Text("Fullerton, CA")
                    .font(.system(size: 35))

                    .font(.system(size: 60))
            }.frame(width: 350, height: 200, alignment: .leading)
            Text("ðŸŒ¤")
                //.font(.system(size: 100))

/* Some problems are:
    - As I adjust the font size of ðŸŒ¤ in the HStack, it shifts the other text and the ðŸŒ¤ emoji goes off screen if it's too big
    - Text() is just temporarily placeholders for the actual data
    - Think there is a much more efficient way to position everything in the HStack including the HStack itself instead of
        just constantly using Spacing()
    - Overrall, things are a little too fixed. Things are moving relative to each other which I don't is what we want. It's probably preferred to be more dynamic and flexible
